Assignment for OOP 2015

Current project will briefly describe one of my favourite hobbies and my results there.

results are taken from 2005 and 2006  years as older data is not available anymore and newer 
data does not exist.

I was doing rifle target shooting and results shown in graph are actual results of competitions


Do not understand how data is getting pulled out of the files. Completely lost

As regardless time spent on figuring out how to add data to the trend line graph is still does not work I decided to display results
as a text in program window.

I also added a small shooting target for fun.
