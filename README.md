Assignment for OOP 2015

Current project will briefly describe one of my favourite hobbies and my results there.

results are taken from 2005, 2006 and 2007 years as older data is not available anymore and newer d
data does not exist.

I was doing rifle target shooting and results shown in graph are actual results of competitions


Do not understand how data is getting pulled out of the files. Completely lost
